This is a simple game created for the [Arnold Clark Hack Day](https://www.arnoldclark.com/careers/digital-product-development/hack-day) tech test:

##### The task

We need you to develop a Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock game.
What the trek?! Don’t worry, it’s an expansion on the classic, made popular by
The Big Bang Theory, just a few additional rules;

- Scissors cuts Paper
- Paper covers Rock
- Rock crushes Lizard
- Lizard poisons Spock
- Spock smashes Scissors
- Scissors decapitates Lizard
- Lizard eats Paper
- Paper disproves Spock
- Spock vaporizes Rock
- (and as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors

##### Running The Game
Currently the game can be run by simply opening the project in [Unity](https://unity.com/). A release build will be added soon after some final bug fixes
